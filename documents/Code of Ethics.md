# Code of Ethics
<div class="version">
### Version 1.0
</div>

The Code of Ethics must be considered by all Staff members of the World Cube Association (WCA), referred to in this document as “WCA Staff”, as a standard for actions and decisions they will be making when acting on behalf of the WCA within their role. “Listed Delegates” refers to WCA Delegates who are publically displayed on the “General info” tab of an official WCA Competition.

These actions and decisions should be made in such a manner that, if consistently performed by WCA Staff, the [Spirit and Mission](wca{documents/motions/01.2019.1 - Spirit.pdf}) of the WCA would continue to be upheld while not breaking any [Regulations](wca{regulations}), [Motions, or Policies](wca{documents}).

This Code covers previously known issues, as well as issues that the WCA Ethics Committee (WEC) foresees as requiring additional guidance. This document will be updated periodically in order to incorporate new topics as they are brought to the attention of the WEC. This document will also be reviewed by the WEC regularly and will be updated as required.

The official communication channel for the WEC is via email. For any concerns about the ethical conduct of a WCA Staff member, contact the WEC: [ethics@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:ethics@worldcubeassociation.org). If there are any concerns about the ethical conduct of the WCA Ethics Committee, either the Committee itself or an individual member, please contact the WCA Disciplinary Committee (WDC) at: [disciplinary@worldcubeassociation.org](mailto:disciplinary@worldcubeassociation.org).

1. **Dealing with Finances**
   1. WCA Staff must not use money obtained from their role within the WCA, including but not limited to competitor fees, expense reimbursement, equipment policies, and sponsorships, for personal profit.
   2. Competition reimbursements for Delegates should only include costs incurred as a direct result of attending the competition as a listed Delegate.
      1. This may include the following personal expenses:
         1. Transportation
         2. Accommodation
         3. Equipment and Printing
      2. Deviations from 1.2.1 require WEC approval before the expense is incurred.
      3. When Delegates are not officially listed and are just attending a competition as competitors, their expenses, including registration fees, are not valid for reimbursement.
   3. Registration fees for listed Delegates and Organizers are permitted to be waived. Registration fees should only be waived for competitors if they perform a role necessary for the running of the competition.
      1. Sole reasons for waiving a competitors registration fee must not include:
         1. Family
         2. Friends
      2. Reminder: Regulations [1e2)](wca{regulations/#1e2}) and [1f2)](wca{regulations/#1f2}) should be used to help  fill scrambling and judging roles during a competition.
      3. Competition volunteer application forms should be available for competitions to help manage and standardize who will be waived for competition volunteer purposes.
      4. If the competition venue is provided for free or for a discounted fee, members of a relevant group can be partially or fully waived from paying the competition’s registration fee if this is a requirement of the venue hire.
         1. Delegates should be wary that any such deal should still be fair and avoid bias towards any unreasonably formed group.
   4. Listed Delegates must request and review an outlined budget for all of their competitions before announcement. Any concerns in the competition budget should be discussed with an organizer and/or the people in charge of the competition finances. Delegates and organizers should work together to find a resolution to any concern.
      1. Competition budgets must be held by the Delegate and if necessary can be requested for review by the WCA Board, WEC, WFC or the Senior Delegate.
      2. The budget of a competition should be in alignment with the Mission and Spirit of the WCA.
      3. Profit acquired from a competition must not be kept for personal gain and should be put towards the benefit of the community.
