# WCA Board Attendance Policy
<div class="version">
### Version 1.0
</div>

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to encourage regular attendance at WCA Board meetings and to provide procedures to address instances of unacceptable levels of attendance.

## Policy
Board members are expected to demonstrate their commitment to the organization by regular attendance at Board meetings, except when prevented by unforeseeable events.

### Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the Chair of the Board to monitor the attendance of each member and to issue warnings as appropriate.

### Attendance Requirements
A Board attendance problem occurs if any of the following conditions exist in regard to a Board member’s attendance to Board meetings:

1. The Board member is absent for two consecutive meetings without first notifying the Chair of their absence.
2. The Board member is absent for three consecutive meetings having notified the Chair of their absence.

### Process
A Board member who demonstrates an attendance problem, as indicated above, is in breach of their obligations and is liable to be removed from the Board, subject to the following process:

1. If a Board member is in breach of their attendance requirements, the Chair shall consult them to discuss this matter.
   1. If the Board member’s difficulties are unresolvable, the Chair shall attempt to resolve them.
      1. If no mutually satisfactory resolution is possible, and if the Board member wishes to continue on the Board, then the member’s response will be put to the Board at its next meeting. The Board member shall be entitled to speak to this item, and to vote on it. The Board will then decide what actions to take regarding that Board member’s future membership on the Board.
2. If the Board decides that termination is justified, the Board may terminate that person’s membership of the Board.
3. When any person has been removed from the Board under this provision, the Board will promptly initiate a process to recruit a new Board member. The person whose membership has been terminated shall retain the right to stand again at the next election for the Board.
