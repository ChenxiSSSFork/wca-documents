# WCA Competition Name Policy
<div class="version">
### Version 1.0
</div>

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to create a professional standard for naming WCA Competitions.

## Policy
WCA Competition names should be approved if they adhere to the following conditions:

- The name must not be too general. It should be related in some way to the competition itself, such as:
  - The location of the competition
  - The competition venue
  - The season or date of the competition
  - The events of the competition
  - The convention the competition is a part of
  - A local cultural reference
  - A sponsor of the competition
- Capitalization of the competition name must be appropriate. The first letter of each word in the competition’s name should be capitalized and subsequent letters within words should be lowercase, except articles and prepositions, which should be always lowercase. Acronyms should be capitalized.
- The name must end with the year of the last day of the competition.
- The competition name must be in Roman letters and may only contain characters from A-Z, a-z, and 0-9, with or without accents. Only '.:-& are permitted as special characters.
- The competition name must be 50 characters or less, including whitespaces.
- If the competition is named after anyone or anything, they must be persons or things lacking any controversial meaning worldwide.
- Competitions may not be named after a living cuber, competition organizer, or any competition staff.
- Names must not contain possibly offensive parts or memes.
- The name cannot contain website domains or anything susceptible to be interpreted as a link, hashtag or in general an electronic identificator.
- The name cannot contain any trademarks (such as “Nike”) unless the organization team is formally authorized, in writing, to use such names.
- Names should not contain any unnecessary parts in the name, like “competition”.

### Championships
The following guidelines should be used when naming national, continental, and world championship competitions.

- Continental and world championships must begin with “WCA”.
- The word “Championship” should be singular in the competition name.
- Competitions which are not national, continental, or world championships should avoid names that are similar to championship names.

Names that do not adhere to the above policy will be rejected. Exceptions can be made at the discretion of the WCA Board. The WCA Board also reserves the right to reject competition names which do not follow the spirit of this policy.

### Examples
The following are examples of acceptable competition names:

- Las Vegas Spring 2018 (competition is named after the city and season)
- Upstate Cubing 2018 (competition is named after the region ‘Upstate’ New York)
- Norwegian Championship 2018 (competition is named after the country)
- Liberty Science Center 2017 (competition is named after the venue)
- Skillcon 2017 (competition is named after the convention it is a part of)

- Speedcube Open 2018 (competition name is too general)
- Las Vegas Spring (competition name does not contain the year)
- Scrambler’s Hell 2018 (competition name can be considered offensive)
